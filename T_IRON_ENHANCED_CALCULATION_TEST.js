// Test file to demonstrate the new calculation functionality

ENHANCED NON-STOCK CALCULATION FUNCTIONALITY

New Features Added:
1. Enhanced calculation fields for non-stock items
2. Flexible unit selection (pcs/L for base, ft/L for multiplier)
3. Real-time calculation display with formula
4. Enhanced display in invoice tables

Example Calculations:
- T Iron 12/pcs × 13ft/pcs × Rs.120 = Rs.18,720
- T Iron 12/L × 13ft/L × Rs.120 = Rs.18,720

How it works:
1. When you add a non-stock product (track_inventory = 0), the enhanced calculation appears
2. You can set:
   - Base Quantity (e.g., 12)
   - Base Unit (pcs or L)
   - Multiplier Quantity (e.g., 13)
   - Multiplier Unit (ft or L)
   - Unit Price (e.g., 120)
3. Formula displays as: "12/pcs × 13ft/pcs × Rs.120 = Rs.18,720"
4. Quantity column shows: "12/pcs × 13ft"
5. Total column shows calculated amount with "(Enhanced Calc)" label

Components Modified:
- InvoiceForm.tsx: Added enhanced calculation UI and logic
- State management for non-stock calculations
- Real-time calculation updates
- Enhanced display in quantity and total columns

Database Fields (already added):
- is_non_stock_item
- t_iron_pieces  
- t_iron_length_per_piece
- t_iron_total_feet
- t_iron_rate_per_foot

Testing Steps:
1. Create a T-Iron product with track_inventory = 0
2. Add it to an invoice
3. The enhanced calculation fields should appear
4. Enter values like: 12 pcs, 13 ft, Rs.120
5. See formula: "12/pcs × 13ft/pcs × Rs.120 = Rs.18,720"
6. Verify the total is calculated correctly
7. Check invoice details and print show the same format

This replaces the modal calculator with inline calculation fields for better user experience.
