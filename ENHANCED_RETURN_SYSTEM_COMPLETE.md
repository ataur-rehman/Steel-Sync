# 🎉 ENHANCED RETURN SYSTEM - PAYMENT STATUS AWARE

## 🚀 **NEW FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Smart Payment Status Checking**
The return system now intelligently checks the original invoice's payment status before processing any credits:

#### ✅ **Fully Paid Invoice**
- Customer gets **FULL credit** for returned items
- Credit amount = Return amount (100%)
- Status: `"Invoice is fully paid - full credit eligible"`

#### ⚠️ **Partially Paid Invoice** 
- Customer gets **PROPORTIONAL credit** based on paid percentage
- Credit amount = Return amount × (Paid amount / Total amount)
- Status: `"Invoice is partially paid (X.X%) - partial credit eligible"`

#### ❌ **Unpaid Invoice**
- Customer gets **NO credit** for returned items
- Credit amount = 0
- Status: `"Invoice is unpaid - no credit eligible"`

### 2. **Invoice Updates for Returns**
When items are returned, the original invoice is automatically updated:

#### ✅ **Item-Level Updates**
- Invoice item quantities are reduced by return quantities
- Return notes are added to each affected item
- Line totals are recalculated automatically

#### ✅ **Invoice-Level Updates** 
- Subtotal, total, and grand total are recalculated
- Total items and quantities are updated
- Return information is added to invoice notes
- Remaining balance is adjusted if needed

### 3. **Complete Audit Trail**
- All return transactions are logged with payment status context
- Invoice updates include return references
- Settlement decisions are documented with reasons

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **New Managers Added**

#### `InvoicePaymentStatusManager`
```typescript
// Check payment status
const paymentStatus = await paymentStatusManager.getInvoicePaymentStatus(invoiceId);

// Determine credit eligibility
const eligibility = paymentStatusManager.determineSettlementEligibility(paymentStatus, returnAmount);
```

#### `InvoiceReturnUpdateManager`
```typescript
// Update invoice to reflect returns
await invoiceUpdateManager.updateInvoiceForReturn(invoiceId, returnData, returnId);
```

Return Amount: Rs. 200
Credit Given: Rs. 200 (100%)
Reason: "Invoice is fully paid - full credit eligible"
```

### Example 2: Partially Paid Invoice  
```
Original Invoice: Rs. 1,000 (Paid: Rs. 600)
Return Amount: Rs. 200
