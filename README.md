# Steel Store Management System

✨ **Ittehad IMS** is a modern desktop application designed to streamline business operations for hardware and iron stores. From inventory and billing to customer/vendor management and financial reporting, the system provides a complete solution in one secure, responsive interface.


## Project Overview

The aim of Ittehad IMS is to digitize manual business processes in small-to-medium hardware and iron shops. Traditionally, these businesses rely on paper-based systems that are error-prone and inefficient. This application replaces them with a robust, desktop-based system built with React, TypeScript, and Tauri, ensuring reliability, speed, and ease of use. This system was developed as a freelance project for a local hardware business, tailored to their operational needs.

Users can manage products, vendors, customers, invoices, and payments, while also monitoring stock and financial performance through an interactive dashboard.
