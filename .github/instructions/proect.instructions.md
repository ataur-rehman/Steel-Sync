# Coding Standards:
# - Maintain high readability, modularity, and error handling.
# - Ensure all unit conversions are precise and verified.
# - Handle concurrency scenarios safely.
# - Avoid hardcoded values; prefer config files or constants.

# Preferences:
# - Comment logic clearly when dealing with unit conversion or business rules.
# - Use clean, production-ready patterns: MVC, layered architecture, or API-first design.
# - Prefer explicit code over clever tricks â€” reliability over brevity.
# - Include validation for numeric inputs and unit formats.
