## üöÄ Technical Implementation Approach

### Core Performance Patterns Applied:
1. **Performance Measurement System**: Real-time monitoring with sessionStorage persistence
2. **React.memo Optimization**: Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. **useCallback & useMemo**: Optimized expensive calculations and event handlers
4. **Early Returns**: Efficient filtering with immediate bailouts for empty results
5. **Parallel Operations**: Promise.all for concurrent data loading
6. **Cached Calculations**: Pre-computed values for sorting and filtering

### Safety Measures Implemented:
- ‚úÖ **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ **Safe Incremental Changes**: Small, tested modifications
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates Preserved**: Event bus integration maintained
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity**: No database schema or API changes
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling with performance tracking

## üìà Performance Monitoring System

### SessionStorage Performance Tracking:
Each page now stores performance history in sessionStorage:
- `invoiceList_performance` - Invoice List performance metrics
- `customerLedger_performance` - Customer Ledger performance metrics  
- `stockReport_performance` - Stock Report performance metrics
- `dailyLedger_performance` - Daily Ledger performance metrics

### Console Performance Logging:
Comprehensive console logging with consistent format:
```javascript
‚ö° [PAGE_NAME_PERF] Operation completed in XXXms
üìä Page loaded: { detailed metrics }
```

### Access Performance Data:
```javascript
// View all performance data
['invoiceList', 'customerLedger', 'stockReport', 'dailyLedger'].forEach(page => {
  const history = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(`${page}_performance`) || '[]');
  console.log(`${page} performance history:`, history);
});
```
