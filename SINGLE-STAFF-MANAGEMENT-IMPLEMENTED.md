# ✅ SINGLE INTEGRATED STAFF MANAGEMENT - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## 🎯 PROBLEM SOLVED

**Issue:** User couldn't see a single staff management component - there were 2 separate modules
**Solution:** Integrated both staff and salary management into ONE unified component

## 🔧 CHANGES MADE

### **1. App Routing Updated (`src/App.tsx`)**

**BEFORE:** Two separate routes
```typescript
// Separate staff management
<Route path="/staff" element={<StaffManagement />} />

// Separate salary management  
<Route path="/staff-salary" element={<StaffSalaryManagement />} />
```

**AFTER:** One integrated route
```typescript
// Single integrated component
<Route path="/staff" element={<StaffManagementIntegrated />} />

// Redirect old salary route to integrated page
<Route path="/staff-salary" element={<Navigate to="/staff" replace />} />
```

### **2. Navigation Menu Updated (`src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`)**

**BEFORE:** Two separate menu items
```typescript
{ name: 'Staff Management', href: '/staff', icon: Users },
{ name: 'Staff Salary', href: '/staff-salary', icon: DollarSign },
```

**AFTER:** One integrated menu item
```typescript
{ name: 'Staff & Salary Management', href: '/staff', icon: Users },
```

### **3. Component Integration**
- ✅ **New Component:** `StaffManagementIntegrated.tsx` (already created)
- ✅ **Replaced:** Both separate staff and salary components
- ✅ **Unified Experience:** All functionality in one interface
