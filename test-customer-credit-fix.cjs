/**
 * üß™ TEST: Customer Credit Fix for Invoice Deletion
 * 
 * This test verifies that when "credit to customer" is selected:
 * 1. Invoice is deleted
 * 2. Invoice creation entries in customer ledger are deleted
 * 3. Payment entries in customer ledger are PRESERVED
 * 4. Payment entries in daily ledger are PRESERVED
 * 5. Customer balance remains properly credited
 * 
 * When "delete payment" is selected:
 * 1. Everything is deleted as before (no changes)
