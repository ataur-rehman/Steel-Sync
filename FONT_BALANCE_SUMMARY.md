# ✅ FONT SIZES NOW PERFECTLY BALANCED!

## 🎨 **WHAT I FIXED**

### **The Problem:**
Your font sizes were jumping around randomly:
- 16px → 11px → 12px → 10px → 13px → 9px
- **Result**: Looked unbalanced and unprofessional

### **The Solution:**
Created a smooth, logical hierarchy:
- **14px** → **12px** → **11px** → **10px** → **9px** → **8px**
- **Result**: Professional, balanced, easy to read
