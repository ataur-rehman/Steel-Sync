console.log('üîß Current Approach vs Better Approach for Invoice Deletion Stock Handling\n');

console.log('‚ùå CURRENT APPROACH (What your code is doing):');
console.log('1. When invoice is created:');
console.log('   - Product: Rice, Stock: 100kg ‚Üí 75kg (sold 25kg)');
console.log('   - Stock Movement: OUT -25kg (reference: invoice 123)');
console.log('');
console.log('2. When invoice is deleted:');
console.log('   - Mark original movement as CANCELLED: "CANCELLED - Invoice deleted"');
console.log('   - Create new restoration movement: IN +25kg (reference: adjustment)');
console.log('   - Final stock: 100kg (correct)');
console.log('');
console.log('üìä RESULT: Stock history shows:');
console.log('   Movement 1: OUT -25kg (CANCELLED - Invoice deleted)');
console.log('   Movement 2: IN +25kg (Stock restored from deleted invoice)');
console.log('   ‚Üí Confusing: Shows two movements for what should be a simple deletion');
console.log('');

console.log('‚úÖ BETTER APPROACH (What you suggest):');
console.log('1. When invoice is created:');
console.log('   - Product: Rice, Stock: 100kg ‚Üí 75kg (sold 25kg)');
console.log('   - Stock Movement: OUT -25kg (reference: invoice 123)');
console.log('');
console.log('2. When invoice is deleted:');
console.log('   - Delete the original stock movement completely');
console.log('   - Recalculate product stock from remaining movements');
console.log('   - Final stock: 100kg (correct)');
console.log('');
console.log('üìä RESULT: Stock history shows:');
console.log('   (No movement - invoice never existed from stock perspective)');
console.log('   ‚Üí Clean: As if the invoice never happened');
console.log('');

console.log('üéØ ADVANTAGES OF THE BETTER APPROACH:');
console.log('‚úÖ Cleaner stock history (no cancelled/restoration entries)');
console.log('‚úÖ Simpler logic (delete instead of cancel + restore)');
console.log('‚úÖ No confusing duplicate movements');
console.log('‚úÖ True reversal (as if transaction never happened)');
console.log('‚úÖ Easier to audit and understand');
console.log('');

console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è CONSIDERATIONS:');
console.log('üîç Audit Trail: Some businesses prefer keeping cancelled movements for audit');
console.log('üîç Complex Cases: Multi-item invoices with partial restores');
console.log('üîç Timing: Need to ensure no other movements happened between creation and deletion');
console.log('');

console.log('üõ†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION:');
console.log(`
// BETTER: Delete original movements and recalculate stock

console.log('üîß TO IMPLEMENT THE BETTER APPROACH:');
console.log('1. Replace the stock restoration logic');
