- ✅ **Dynamic Analytics**: Real-time calculation of statistics from database
- ✅ **Transaction History**: Displays actual payment records from database
- ✅ **Improved Data Loading**: Added dedicated `getPaymentChannel()` method for single channel retrieval

### **2. PaymentChannelManagement.tsx**
- ✅ **Real Database Queries**: Uses `db.getPaymentChannels()` and `db.getPaymentChannelStats()`
- ✅ **Live Statistics**: Shows actual transaction volumes and counts
- ✅ **Active Channel Management**: Real-time status management with database persistence

### **3. Database Service Methods**
- ✅ **getPaymentChannels()**: Returns real channels with transaction statistics
- ✅ **getPaymentChannel()**: New method for single channel retrieval with stats
- ✅ **getPaymentChannelAnalytics()**: Comprehensive analytics from real data
- ✅ **getPaymentChannelTransactions()**: Fixed to check both enhanced_payments and payments tables

## **🔍 Database Fixes Applied**

### **Payment Channel Linkage Fix**
**Problem**: Payments were being created with `payment_channel_id = null`
**Solution**: Modified `createCustomerLedgerEntries()` method to:
```typescript
// Find or create appropriate payment channel
let paymentChannelId = null;
const existingChannel = await this.dbConnection.select(`
  SELECT id, name FROM payment_channels 
  WHERE (LOWER(name) = LOWER(?) OR LOWER(type) = LOWER(?)) AND is_active = 1 
  LIMIT 1
`, [paymentMethod, paymentMethod]);

if (existingChannel && existingChannel.length > 0) {
  paymentChannelId = existingChannel[0].id;
} else {
  // Auto-create payment channel if none exists
  const channelResult = await this.dbConnection.execute(`
    INSERT INTO payment_channels (name, type, description, is_active)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, 1)
  `, [paymentMethod, paymentMethod.toLowerCase(), `Auto-created for ${paymentMethod}`]);
  paymentChannelId = channelResult.lastInsertId;
}
```

### **Transaction Query Enhancement**
**Enhanced**: `getPaymentChannelTransactions()` to fallback from enhanced_payments to payments table:
```typescript
// Try enhanced_payments first, then fallback to payments table
if (enhancedCheck[0] && enhancedCheck[0].count > 0) {
  // Use enhanced_payments
} else {
  // Fallback to payments table
  transactions = await this.safeSelect(`
    SELECT p.*, c.name as actual_customer_name, i.bill_number as invoice_number
    FROM payments p
    LEFT JOIN customers c ON p.customer_id = c.id
    LEFT JOIN invoices i ON p.reference_invoice_id = i.id
    WHERE p.payment_channel_id = ?
  `, [channelId]);
}
```
