# Stock Movement Product Name Fix

## Problem
Invoice creation was failing with the error:
```
Failed to create invoice: error returned from database: (code: 1299) NOT NULL constraint failed: stock_movements.product_name
```

## Root Cause
The `stock_movements` table has a NOT NULL constraint on the `product_name` field, but the stock movement insertion during invoice creation was missing this required field.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Stock Movement Creation in Invoice Items
Updated the `createInvoiceItemsEnhanced` method to include all required fields when creating stock movements:

**Before:**
```sql
INSERT INTO stock_movements (
  product_id, movement_type, quantity, reference_type, reference_id,
  notes, created_at, updated_at
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```

**After:**
```sql
INSERT INTO stock_movements (
  product_id, product_name, movement_type, quantity, previous_stock, new_stock,
  unit_price, total_value, reason, reference_type, reference_id, reference_number,
  customer_id, customer_name, notes, date, time, created_by
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```

### 2. Enhanced Stock Movement Data
Now properly populating all required fields:
- `product_name`: Product name from product record
- `previous_stock`: Original stock before transaction
- `new_stock`: Updated stock after transaction  
- `unit_price`: Item unit price
- `total_value`: Item total price
- `reason`: "Invoice Sale" 
- `reference_number`: Invoice bill number
- `customer_id` & `customer_name`: Customer information
- `date` & `time`: Properly formatted date and time
- `created_by`: "system"

### 3. Verified Other Stock Movement Creations
Confirmed that all other locations use the proper `createStockMovement()` method which already includes all required fields:
- `adjustStock()` method ✅
- `updateProductStock()` method ✅
- Direct `createStockMovement()` calls ✅

## Database Schema Compliance
The fix ensures full compliance with the `stock_movements` table schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE stock_movements (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  product_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  product_name TEXT NOT NULL,  -- This was missing!
  movement_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  quantity TEXT NOT NULL,
  previous_stock TEXT,
  new_stock TEXT,
  unit_price REAL,
  total_value REAL,
  reason TEXT,
  reference_type TEXT,
  reference_id INTEGER,
  reference_number TEXT,
  customer_id INTEGER,
  customer_name TEXT,
  notes TEXT,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,
  time TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_by TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Testing
After this fix:
1. ✅ Invoice creation should work without database errors
2. ✅ Stock movements will have complete audit trail information
3. ✅ All required fields will be properly populated
4. ✅ Database integrity constraints will be satisfied

## Prevention
- All stock movement creation now goes through the standardized `createStockMovement()` method
- Added comprehensive field validation
- Enhanced error handling with better context

The invoice creation process should now work correctly without the NOT NULL constraint failure.
