# Vendor Payment Stock Receiving Number Display Fix

## Issue Description
Vendor payments in the Daily Ledger were not showing stock receiving numbers (like "S01") even though the data was being retrieved from the database. The display was showing:

```
Vendor Payment
03:37 am
Karach Asia
Rs. 112,500
Bank Transfer
```

Instead of the expected:
```
Vendor Payment
03:37 am
Karach Asia
S01                    ‚Üê Missing stock receiving number
Rs. 112,500
Bank Transfer
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Data Retrieval (‚úÖ Working Correctly)
The database query in `generateSystemEntries()` was correctly joining vendor payments with stock receivings:

```sql
SELECT vp.*, 
       v.name as vendor_name,
       pc.name as payment_channel_name,
       pc.type as payment_method,
       sr.receiving_number              ‚Üê This was being fetched correctly
FROM vendor_payments vp
LEFT JOIN vendors v ON vp.vendor_id = v.id
LEFT JOIN payment_channels pc ON vp.payment_channel_id = pc.id
LEFT JOIN stock_receivings sr ON vp.receiving_id = sr.id  ‚Üê Proper join
WHERE vp.date = ? AND vp.amount > 0
```

### Data Processing (‚úÖ Working Correctly)  
The vendor payment processing was correctly storing the receiving number:

```javascript
if (payment.receiving_number) {
  notes = `Stock Receiving #${payment.receiving_number}`;  ‚Üê Correctly stored
}
```

### Display Logic (‚ùå The Problem)
The issue was in the `getCleanFormat()` function's vendor payment case. The logic was too restrictive and not properly extracting the stock receiving number for display.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Display Logic
Updated the vendor payment case in `getCleanFormat()` to properly handle stock receiving numbers:

```javascript
case 'Vendor Payment':
  // ... vendor name extraction logic ...
  
  // Enhanced stock receiving display - prioritize stock receiving numbers
  if (entry.notes) {
    // Check for stock receiving number patterns
    if (entry.notes.includes('Stock Receiving #')) {
      // Extract just the receiving number (e.g., "S01" from "Stock Receiving #S01")
      const receivingMatch = entry.notes.match(/Stock Receiving #([A-Z]\d+)/i);
      if (receivingMatch) {
        secondaryText = receivingMatch[1]; // Show just "S01"
      } else {
        secondaryText = entry.notes; // Show full text as fallback
      }
    } else if (entry.notes.includes('SR') || entry.notes.match(/^[A-Z]\d+$/)) {
      // Handle other stock receiving patterns like "SR01" or just "S01"
      secondaryText = entry.notes;
    } else if (entry.notes.includes('Reference:')) {
      // Show reference numbers
      const refMatch = entry.notes.match(/Reference:\s*(.+)/);
      if (refMatch) {
        secondaryText = refMatch[1].trim();
      }
    } else if (!entry.notes.toLowerCase().includes('payment') && 
              !entry.notes.toLowerCase().includes('vendor') &&
              entry.notes.length > 0) {
      // Show other meaningful notes
      secondaryText = entry.notes;
    }
  }
  
  // If no meaningful notes but we have bill_number, show it
  if (!secondaryText && entry.bill_number) {
    secondaryText = entry.bill_number;
  }
  break;
```

### Added Debug Logging
Enhanced vendor payment processing with detailed logging to track data flow:

```javascript
console.log('üîç [DailyLedger] Processing vendor payment:', {
  id: payment.id,
  vendor_name: payment.vendor_name,
  receiving_number: payment.receiving_number,  ‚Üê Track if this exists
  reference_number: payment.reference_number,
  notes: payment.notes,
  amount: payment.amount
});
```

## Expected Result

After this fix, vendor payments should display:

```
1. Vendor Payment
   03:37 am
   Karach Asia
   S01                    ‚Üê Stock receiving number now displayed
   
   Rs. 112,500
   Bank Transfer
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Pattern Matching**: Enhanced regex patterns to extract stock receiving numbers
2. **Fallback Handling**: Multiple fallback options for different data formats
3. **Clean Display**: Shows just "S01" instead of "Stock Receiving #S01" for cleaner UI
4. **Debug Visibility**: Added comprehensive logging to track data flow
5. **Robust Extraction**: Handles various receiving number formats (S01, SR01, etc.)

## Data Flow Summary

1. **Database**: `stock_receivings.receiving_number` ‚Üí vendor payment query
2. **Processing**: `payment.receiving_number` ‚Üí `notes = "Stock Receiving #S01"`  
3. **Display**: `entry.notes` ‚Üí regex extraction ‚Üí `secondaryText = "S01"`
4. **UI**: Shows "S01" below vendor name

## Testing Notes

To verify the fix:
1. Open Daily Ledger for a date with vendor payments
2. Check browser console for debug logs showing receiving numbers
3. Verify stock receiving numbers appear below vendor names
4. Confirm other vendor payment details (reference numbers, notes) still display correctly

## Files Modified

- `e:\claude Pro\steel-store-management\src\components\reports\DailyLedger.tsx`
  - Enhanced `getCleanFormat()` vendor payment case
  - Added debug logging in vendor payment processing

This fix ensures that stock receiving numbers are prominently displayed for vendor payments while maintaining clean, non-redundant formatting throughout the Daily Ledger.
