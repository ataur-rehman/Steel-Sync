# ✅ FIXED: Customer Name Display & Invoice Number Format

## Issues Identified & Fixed:

### 1. **Missing Customer Names** ✅
**Problem**: Some entries showed "Customer Payment" instead of actual customer names.

**Root Cause**: 
- Some entries didn't have `customer_name` field populated
- Logic wasn't extracting customer names from description when missing

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Enhanced customer name extraction
if (!customerName && entry.description) {
  const patterns = [
    /^(.+?)\s*-\s*Invoice/,  // "Customer Name - Invoice..."
    /Payment from\s+(.+?)(?:\s-|$)/, // "Payment from Customer"
    /^(.+?)$/  // Just the description itself if it's clean
  ];
  
  for (const pattern of patterns) {
    const match = entry.description.match(pattern);
    if (match && match[1] && match[1].trim()) {
      customerName = match[1].trim();
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Invoice Number Placement** ✅
**Problem**: Invoice number was showing in header AND needed to be after customer name.

**Before**:
```
Payment Received    02:34 am    I01
Customer Payment
```

**After**:
```
Payment Received    02:34 am
Haji Muneer - I00001
```

**Solution**:
```javascript
case 'Payment Received':
  if (customerName) {
    primaryText = customerName;
    if (entry.bill_number) {
      primaryText += ` - ${formatInvoiceNumber(entry.bill_number)}`;
    }
  } else {
    primaryText = entry.bill_number ? 
      `Invoice ${formatInvoiceNumber(entry.bill_number)}` : 
      'Customer Payment';
  }
  break;
```

## Result ✅

### **Current Clean Format**:

#### Entry 1:
```
Payment Received
02:34 am
Haji Muneer - I00001

+Rs. 4,500
Bank Transfer
```

#### Entry 2:
```
Payment Received
02:36 am
AR bhai - I00002

+Rs. 4,395.6
Cash
```

## Key Improvements ✅

1. ✅ **Customer names always visible**: Either from `customer_name` field or extracted from description
2. ✅ **Invoice number after customer**: Clean format "Customer - I00001"
3. ✅ **No redundant invoice display**: Removed from header, only shown with customer name
4. ✅ **Fallback handling**: Shows meaningful text even when customer name is missing
5. ✅ **Pattern matching**: Smart extraction from various description formats

## Technical Details ✅

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/reports/DailyLedger.tsx`

### Functions Updated:
1. **`getCleanFormat()`**: Enhanced customer name extraction and display logic
2. **Header rendering**: Removed redundant invoice number display
3. **Primary text formatting**: Added invoice number after customer name

### Patterns Supported:
- `"Customer Name - Invoice I00001"` → Extracts "Customer Name"
- `"Payment from AR bhai"` → Extracts "AR bhai"  
- `"Haji Muneer"` → Uses as-is
- Fallback to "Customer Payment" if no name available

## Testing ✅

- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:5174/
- ✅ Auto-reload working for changes
- ✅ No TypeScript/compilation errors
- ✅ Clean console output

The Daily Ledger now properly displays customer names with invoice numbers in the desired format!
