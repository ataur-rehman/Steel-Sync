## Issues Resolved

### Issue 01: Stock Receiving Page - Missing Columns
**Errors**: 
- `table stock_receiving has no column named payment_status`
- `table stock_receiving has no column named truck_number`
- `table stock_receiving has no column named reference_number`
- `table stock_receiving has no column named created_by`

**Fix Applied**:
1. ✅ Added `payment_status` column to `addMissingColumns()` method
2. ✅ Added `truck_number` column to `addMissingColumns()` method  
3. ✅ Added `reference_number` column to `addMissingColumns()` method
4. ✅ Added `created_by` column to `addMissingColumns()` method
5. ✅ Updated `createInventoryTables()` method to include all missing columns
6. ✅ Added default value migration for existing records

**SQL Fix**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE stock_receiving ADD COLUMN payment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (payment_status IN ('pending', 'partial', 'paid'));
ALTER TABLE stock_receiving ADD COLUMN truck_number TEXT;
ALTER TABLE stock_receiving ADD COLUMN reference_number TEXT;
ALTER TABLE stock_receiving ADD COLUMN created_by TEXT DEFAULT 'system';
UPDATE stock_receiving SET payment_status = 'pending' WHERE payment_status IS NULL OR payment_status = '';
```

### Issue 02: Staff Management Page - Missing `entity_id` Column
**Error**: `no such column: entity_id`

**Fix Applied**:
1. ✅ Added `entity_id` column to `addMissingColumns()` method
2. ✅ Updated `audit_logs` table creation to include `entity_id` column
3. ✅ Added migration to populate `entity_id` from existing `record_id`

**SQL Fix**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE audit_logs ADD COLUMN entity_id TEXT;
UPDATE audit_logs SET entity_id = CAST(record_id AS TEXT) WHERE entity_id IS NULL OR entity_id = '';
```

### Issue 03: Business Finance Page - Missing `payment_amount` Column
**Error**: `no such column: payment_amount`

**Fix Applied**:
1. ✅ Added `payment_amount` column to multiple financial tables
2. ✅ Enhanced `addMissingColumns()` method to handle all financial tables
3. ✅ Set default values for existing records

**SQL Fix**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN payment_amount REAL DEFAULT 0.0;
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN payment_amount REAL DEFAULT 0.0;
ALTER TABLE vendor_payments ADD COLUMN payment_amount REAL DEFAULT 0.0;
ALTER TABLE expense_transactions ADD COLUMN payment_amount REAL DEFAULT 0.0;
ALTER TABLE salary_payments ADD COLUMN payment_amount REAL DEFAULT 0.0;
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/services/database.ts`
- Enhanced `addMissingColumns()` method with comprehensive fixes
- Updated `createCriticalTables()` to include missing columns
- Fixed `audit_logs` table creation to include `entity_id`
- Added public `fixDatabaseSchema()` method for manual repairs

### 2. `test/database-schema-fixes.test.ts` (New)
- Created comprehensive test suite to verify all fixes
- Tests for each missing column issue
- Functional tests for affected operations

### 3. `scripts/repair-database-schema.ts` (New)
- Standalone utility to run schema repairs manually
- Provides detailed reporting of fixes applied
- Can be run independently to resolve schema issues

## How to Apply Fixes

### Automatic Fix (Recommended)
The fixes will be applied automatically when the database is initialized:
```typescript
const db = DatabaseService.getInstance();
await db.initialize(); // Fixes are applied during initialization
```

### Manual Fix
If issues persist, run the manual repair:
```typescript
const db = DatabaseService.getInstance();
await db.initialize();
const result = await db.fixDatabaseSchema();
console.log(result); // Shows what was fixed
```

### Command Line Repair
Run the standalone repair script:
```bash
npm run repair-schema  # If you add this to package.json
# or
ts-node scripts/repair-database-schema.ts
```

## Verification

After applying fixes, verify they work:

1. **Stock Receiving**: Should create without `payment_status` column errors
2. **Staff Management**: Should load without `entity_id` column errors  
3. **Business Finance**: Should display data without `payment_amount` column errors

## Prevention

These fixes include:
- ✅ Proper column constraints and defaults
- ✅ Migration of existing data
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Rollback safety (won't break existing data)
- ✅ Idempotent operations (safe to run multiple times)

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify all fixes:
```bash
npm test test/database-schema-fixes.test.ts
```

All database operations should now work without the reported column errors.
