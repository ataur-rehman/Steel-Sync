# 🧪 TESTING PLAN: Guest Customer & Quick Customer Features

## 📋 **Testing Overview**

This document outlines the testing plan to verify that all guest customer and quick customer creation fixes are working correctly after resolving the foreign key constraint issues.

## 🎯 **Test Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Guest Customer Invoice Creation**

**Objective:** Verify guest customers can create invoices without database storage issues

**Steps:**
1. Open the invoice form
2. Toggle "Guest Mode" switch
3. Enter guest customer details:
   - Name: "John Smith"
   - Phone: "123-456-7890"
   - Address: "123 Main St" (optional)
4. Add products to invoice
5. Click "Create Invoice"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed" error
- ✅ Invoice created successfully
- ✅ Guest customer record (ID = -1) automatically created if doesn't exist
- ✅ Invoice appears in invoice list as "John Smith (Guest)"
- ✅ No customer balance updates
- ✅ No ledger entries created

### **Scenario 2: Quick Customer Creation**

**Objective:** Verify quick customer creation works within invoice form

**Steps:**
1. Open the invoice form
2. Ensure Guest Mode is OFF
3. Click "Create New Customer" button
4. Fill in customer details:
   - Name: "New Customer"
   - Phone: "987-654-3210"
   - Address: "456 Oak Ave"
   - Customer Type: "retail"
5. Click "Save Customer"
6. Add products to invoice
7. Click "Create Invoice"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Customer created and saved to database
- ✅ Customer automatically selected in dropdown
- ✅ Form validation passes
- ✅ No "Please fix the errors before submitting" message
- ✅ Invoice created with proper customer_id
- ✅ Customer balance updated
- ✅ Ledger entries created

### **Scenario 3: Form Validation**

**Objective:** Verify enhanced form validation works correctly

**Test Cases:**

**3.1: Guest Mode - Missing Name**
- Toggle Guest Mode ON
- Leave guest name empty
- Try to submit
- Expected: Error message about missing guest name

**3.2: Guest Mode - Valid Data**
- Toggle Guest Mode ON
- Enter guest name and phone
- Add products
- Expected: Form submits successfully

**3.3: Regular Mode - No Customer Selected**
- Guest Mode OFF
- Don't select any customer
- Try to submit
- Expected: Error message about selecting customer

**3.4: Regular Mode - Valid Selection**
- Guest Mode OFF
- Select existing customer
- Add products
- Expected: Form submits successfully

### **Scenario 4: Invoice List Display**

**Objective:** Verify guest invoices display correctly in invoice lists

**Steps:**
1. Create a guest invoice (Scenario 1)
2. Create a regular invoice (Scenario 2)
3. Navigate to invoice list/history

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Regular invoice shows: "Customer Name"
- ✅ Guest invoice shows: "Guest Name (Guest)"
- ✅ Both invoices appear in chronological order
- ✅ All invoice details display correctly

### **Scenario 5: Database Integrity**

**Objective:** Verify database constraints and data integrity

**Verification Points:**
1. Check guest customer record exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = -1;
   ```

2. Verify guest invoices reference guest customer:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE customer_id = -1;
   ```

3. Confirm foreign key constraint satisfied:
   ```sql
   PRAGMA foreign_key_check;
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Guest customer record exists with ID = -1
- ✅ Guest invoices have customer_id = -1
- ✅ No foreign key constraint violations
- ✅ All regular customer relationships intact

## 🐛 **Error Scenarios to Test**

### **Error 1: Network/Database Failure**
- Simulate database unavailable
- Try to create guest invoice
- Expected: Proper error message, no partial data

### **Error 2: Invalid Product IDs**
- Add non-existent product to invoice
- Try to submit
- Expected: Product validation error, no invoice creation

### **Error 3: Concurrent Guest Customer Creation**
- Multiple users create guest invoices simultaneously
- Expected: No duplicate guest customer records, all invoices succeed

## 📊 **Success Criteria**

### **Must Pass (Critical):**
- ✅ No FOREIGN KEY constraint failed errors
- ✅ Guest invoices create successfully
- ✅ Guest invoices appear in lists
- ✅ Quick customer creation works
- ✅ Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- ✅ Database integrity maintained

### **Should Pass (Important):**
- ✅ Clear error messages for validation failures
- ✅ Proper debugging information in console
- ✅ Performance not degraded
- ✅ UI remains responsive during operations

### **Nice to Have (Enhancement):**
- ✅ Smooth transitions between guest/regular modes
- ✅ Intuitive user experience
- ✅ Consistent styling and behavior

## 🛠️ **Testing Tools**

### **1. Browser Console Testing**
Run the verification script:
```javascript
// Load GUEST_CUSTOMER_FIX_VERIFICATION_TEST.js in browser console
const tester = new FixVerificationTester();
tester.runAllTests();
```

### **2. Database Inspection**
Check database state during testing:
```sql
-- Check guest customer
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = -1;

-- Check guest invoices
SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE customer_id = -1;

-- Check foreign key constraints
PRAGMA foreign_key_check;
```

### **3. Network Dev Tools**
Monitor database requests:
- Check for failed requests
- Verify proper error handling
- Confirm transaction rollbacks

## 📝 **Test Execution Checklist**
