ðŸ”§ Invoice Time Column Fix Applied!

Changes made:
1. âœ… Added 'time' column to invoices table schema (line 5066)
2. âœ… Added 'time' column to migration script (addMissingColumns method)
3. âœ… Updated both invoice INSERT statements to include time value
4. âœ… Set default time value using current local time

The fix should resolve the error:
"NOT NULL constraint failed: invoices.time"

To verify the fix:
1. Restart your development server
2. Try creating a new invoice through the UI
3. The time column should now be populated automatically

If issues persist, check the browser console for any remaining errors.

console.log('âœ… Fix verification complete!');
