/**
 * COMPREHENSIVE STOCK RECEIVING AUTO-UPDATE FIX
 * 
 * This file documents and fixes the issue where stock quantities do not
 * automatically update in the UI after creating stock receiving records.
 * 
 * ISSUE ANALYSIS:
 * ===============
 * 1. The database correctly updates stock quantities in `createStockReceiving()`
 * 2. The problem is inconsistent event emission and listening
 * 3. Some components listen for `BUSINESS_EVENTS.STOCK_UPDATED` ('stock:updated')
 * 4. But the database was emitting plain `'STOCK_UPDATED'` events
 * 5. Users were pressing Ctrl+S thinking it would manually save/update
 * 
 * FIXED COMPONENTS:
 * ================
 * 1. StockReceivingNew.tsx - Enhanced event emission with correct BUSINESS_EVENTS
 * 2. database.ts - Fixed createStockReceiving to emit correct events
 * 3. Added Ctrl+S handler with user education
 * 4. Added immediate UI refresh triggers
 * 
 * COMPONENTS THAT AUTO-UPDATE:
 * ===========================
 * - Dashboard.tsx (listens for STOCK_UPDATED via useAutoRefresh)
 * - StockReport.tsx (listens for BUSINESS_EVENTS.STOCK_UPDATED)
 * - InvoiceForm.tsx (has refreshProductData function)
 * - Business Finance Dashboard (via finance service cache clearing)
 * 
 * TESTING CHECKLIST:
 * ==================
 * 1. Create a stock receiving with products
 * 2. Check Dashboard low stock count updates immediately
 * 3. Check Stock Report shows updated quantities immediately
 * 4. Check Product lists in Invoice Form show updated stock
 * 5. Verify no need to press Ctrl+S or manually refresh
 * 
 * EVENT FLOW:
 * ===========
 * Stock Receiving Created
 *   ‚Üì
 * Database updates product.current_stock
 *   ‚Üì
 * Emits BUSINESS_EVENTS.STOCK_UPDATED for each product
 *   ‚Üì  
 * StockReceivingNew emits additional events
 *   ‚Üì
 * Components listening for events refresh their data
 *   ‚Üì
 * UI shows updated stock quantities immediately
