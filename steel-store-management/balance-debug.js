// This is a simplified test script to understand the balance calculation issues
// The main problems identified:
// 1. Field name mismatch: query returns 'balance' but component expects 'total_balance'
// 2. Complex balance calculation logic might be incorrect

  issues: [
    'Database query returns "balance" field but CustomerList component expects "total_balance"',
    'Balance calculation joins invoices and payments separately which can cause double counting',
    'Payment type logic treats certain payment types as negative which might be incorrect',
    'Should use customer_ledger_entries table which maintains accurate running balance'
  ],
  
  solutions: [
    'Change database query to alias balance field as total_balance',
    'Use latest balance_after from customer_ledger_entries for accuracy',
    'Simplify balance logic to avoid complex joins that can double count',
    'Verify payment type handling is correct for the business logic'
