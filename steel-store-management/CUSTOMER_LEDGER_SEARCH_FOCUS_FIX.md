# Customer Ledger Search Input Focus Fix

## Issue Description
The search input in the Customer Ledger was losing focus after typing each character, causing a poor user experience where users had to click back into the input field after every keystroke.

## Root Cause
The `CustomerListView` component was defined **inside** the main `CustomerLedger` component, which meant it was being recreated on every render. When React re-renders the parent component, the child component gets recreated, causing the DOM to rebuild the input element and losing focus.

## Solution
**Moved the `CustomerListView` component outside of the main `CustomerLedger` component.**

### Changes Made:
1. **Extracted `CustomerListView`**: Moved the component definition from inside `CustomerLedger` to the top level of the file
2. **Moved Interface**: Also moved the `CustomerListViewProps` interface outside the main component
3. **Added displayName**: Added `CustomerListView.displayName = 'CustomerListView'` for better debugging
4. **Maintained React.memo**: Kept the `React.memo` wrapper to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Code Structure Before:
```tsx
const CustomerLedger: React.FC = () => {
  // ... state and hooks
  
  const CustomerListView = React.memo(() => {
    // Component definition inside main component
  });
  
  // ... rest of component
};
```

### Code Structure After:
```tsx
// Outside the main component
interface CustomerListViewProps { ... }

const CustomerListView: React.FC<CustomerListViewProps> = React.memo(() => {
  // Component definition at top level
});

CustomerListView.displayName = 'CustomerListView';

const CustomerLedger: React.FC = () => {
  // ... state and hooks
  // ... rest of component
};
```

## Benefits
1. **Fixed Focus Issue**: Search input no longer loses focus after typing
2. **Better Performance**: Component is not recreated on every render
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Component is properly extracted and reusable
4. **Maintained Memoization**: React.memo still prevents unnecessary re-renders

## Testing
- ✅ Search input maintains focus while typing
- ✅ Component compilation successful 
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Memoization working correctly

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
The search input focus issue has been resolved by properly extracting the CustomerListView component.
