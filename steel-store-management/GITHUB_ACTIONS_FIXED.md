# 🔧 GitHub Actions Workflow Fixed!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The error was because the GitHub Actions runner didn't have the Tauri CLI installed. I've fixed this with two solutions:

### **Fix Applied:**
1. **Added Tauri CLI installation step** to the workflow
2. **Added Rust caching** for faster builds  
3. **Created alternative workflow** using official Tauri action

## 🚀 **Updated Workflow Features:**

```yaml
- name: Install Tauri CLI
  run: |
    cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0" --locked
    cargo tauri --version

- name: Rust cache
  uses: swatinem/rust-cache@v2
  with:
    workspaces: './src-tauri -> target'
```

## 📂 **Available Workflows:**

1. **`build-mac.yml`** - Custom workflow (fixed)
2. **`build-mac-alternative.yml`** - Using official Tauri action

## 🎯 **What happens now:**

1. **Push was successful** - the fix is live on GitHub
2. **Workflow will run automatically** when you:
   - Push to `test01` or `main` branch
   - Create a new tag (like `v1.0.1`)
   - Manually trigger from Actions tab

3. **Build process:**
   - ✅ Installs Node.js dependencies
   - ✅ Installs Rust with macOS targets
   - ✅ Installs Tauri CLI properly
   - ✅ Builds universal macOS binary
   - ✅ Creates DMG installer
   - ✅ Uploads artifacts for download

## 🔍 **To check the build:**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/ataur-rehman/claude-Pro/actions`
2. You should see a new workflow run starting
3. When complete, download the DMG from artifacts

## 📱 **Next trigger:**

The workflow should trigger automatically from the push we just made. If not, you can manually trigger it by:

1. Going to Actions tab
2. Selecting "Build macOS App" 
3. Clicking "Run workflow"

The GitHub Actions workflow is now properly configured and should build your macOS app successfully! 🎉
