# 📋 VENDOR DEACTIVATION & REACTIVATION GUIDE

## 🎯 **How to Manage Vendor Status**

Your vendor management system now has comprehensive status management with **deactivation** and **reactivation** capabilities.

## 🔍 **Where to Find Deactivated Vendors**

### **1. Filter Options**
In the Vendor Management page, you'll see a dropdown filter with these options:
- **"All Vendors"** - Shows both active and inactive vendors
- **"Active Only"** - Shows only active vendors  
- **"Inactive Only"** - Shows only deactivated vendors ⭐

### **2. Status Indicators**
Each vendor row shows:
- **Green badge** = Active vendor
- **Red badge** = Inactive/Deactivated vendor

## ⚙️ **How to Deactivate a Vendor**

### **For Active Vendors:**
1. Go to **Vendor Management** page
2. Find the vendor you want to deactivate
3. Click the **⏸️ (Pause)** button in the Actions column
4. Confirm the deactivation in the popup dialog
5. ✅ Vendor is now deactivated (preserves all data)

### **Alternative: Automatic Deactivation**
- When you try to **delete** a vendor with pending payments
- System will ask if you want to **deactivate instead**
- This safely preserves the vendor while making them inactive

## 🔄 **How to Reactivate a Vendor**

### **For Inactive Vendors:**
1. Go to **Vendor Management** page
2. Set filter to **"Inactive Only"** or **"All Vendors"**
3. Find the deactivated vendor (will have red "Inactive" badge)
4. Click the **▶️ (Play)** button in the Actions column
5. ✅ Vendor is immediately reactivated

## 🎨 **Visual Differences**

### **Active Vendor Actions:**
- 👁️ **View Details**
- ✏️ **Edit Vendor** 
- ⏸️ **Deactivate Vendor** (new)
- 🗑️ **Delete Vendor**

### **Inactive Vendor Actions:**
- 👁️ **View Details**
- ✏️ **Edit Vendor**
- ▶️ **Reactivate Vendor** (new)
- 🗑️ **Delete Vendor** (still available)

## 📊 **Statistics Display**

The filter dropdown shows real-time counts:
- **All Vendors (25)** - Total vendor count
- **Active Only (20)** - Currently active vendors
- **Inactive Only (5)** - Currently deactivated vendors

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

### **Deactivation Benefits:**
- ✅ **Preserves all historical data**
- ✅ **Maintains purchase records**
- ✅ **Keeps payment history intact**
- ✅ **Can be easily reversed**

### **When to Use Deactivation vs Deletion:**
- **Deactivate:** Vendor no longer used but has historical data
- **Delete:** Only when vendor has no transactions (system prevents unsafe deletions)

## 🚀 **Quick Actions**

### **To View Only Inactive Vendors:**
1. Click the filter dropdown
2. Select **"Inactive Only"**
3. All deactivated vendors will be displayed

### **To Reactivate Multiple Vendors:**
1. Filter to **"Inactive Only"**
2. Click **▶️** button for each vendor you want to reactivate
3. Each reactivation happens instantly with confirmation

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

1. **Regular Review:** Periodically check inactive vendors to see if any should be reactivated
2. **Data Preservation:** Use deactivation instead of deletion for vendors with transaction history
3. **Clear Filtering:** Use status filters to focus on the vendors you need to manage
4. **Activity Logging:** All deactivation/reactivation actions are logged for audit purposes
