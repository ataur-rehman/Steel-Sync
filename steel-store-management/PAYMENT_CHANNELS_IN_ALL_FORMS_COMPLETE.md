# Payment Channels Now Available in All Forms - COMPLETE

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED
The payment channels are now successfully available in all forms. The issue was that the `payment_channels` table didn't exist in the database, so all forms were trying to load empty payment channel data.

## 🔧 SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Fixed Table Creation
- **Enhanced `getPaymentChannels()`**: Added `ensurePaymentChannelsTable()` call
- **Default Data Creation**: Added automatic creation of default payment channels
- **Manual Table Setup**: Created SQL script and manually executed to populate initial data

### 2. Created Default Payment Channels
The following payment channels are now available in all forms:
1. **Cash** (cash) - Physical cash payments
2. **Bank Transfer** (bank) - Electronic bank transfers  
3. **Credit Card** (card) - Credit card payments (2.5% fee)
4. **Cheque** (cheque) - Cheque payments
5. **JazzCash** (digital) - JazzCash mobile wallet (PKR 10 fixed fee)
6. **EasyPaisa** (digital) - EasyPaisa mobile wallet (PKR 10 fixed fee)
