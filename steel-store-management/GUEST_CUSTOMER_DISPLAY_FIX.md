# ðŸ”§ GUEST CUSTOMER DISPLAY FIX - VERIFICATION

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Fixed**

**Problem:** Guest customer invoices were showing "Guest Customer" instead of the actual guest name and phone entered during invoice creation.

**Root Cause:** The `getInvoiceWithDetails` method was using `LEFT JOIN customers c` and selecting `c.name as customer_name`, which pulled the placeholder record name "Guest Customer" instead of the actual guest details stored in the invoices table.

## âœ… **Solution Applied**

### **Fixed Query in `getInvoiceWithDetails`:**
```sql
SELECT 
  i.*,
  CASE 
    WHEN i.customer_id = -1 THEN i.customer_name
    ELSE c.name
  END as customer_name,
  CASE 
    WHEN i.customer_id = -1 THEN i.customer_phone
    ELSE c.phone
  END as customer_phone,
  CASE 
    WHEN i.customer_id = -1 THEN i.customer_address
    ELSE c.address
  END as customer_address
FROM invoices i
LEFT JOIN customers c ON i.customer_id = c.id
WHERE i.id = ?
```

### **Key Changes:**
- **For Guest Customers (customer_id = -1):** Use data from invoices table (`i.customer_name`, `i.customer_phone`, `i.customer_address`)
- **For Regular Customers:** Use data from customers table (`c.name`, `c.phone`, `c.address`)
- **Conditional Logic:** `CASE WHEN` statements to choose the correct data source

## ðŸ”„ **Additional Methods Fixed**

1. **`getRecentInvoices`** - Fixed to show actual guest names instead of "Guest Customer"
2. **`getOverdueInvoices`** - Fixed to show actual guest names instead of "Guest Customer"  
3. **Dashboard Top Customers** - Fixed to group all guest customers as "Guest Customers"

## ðŸ“‹ **Testing Steps**

### **Test 1: Create Guest Invoice**
1. Open Invoice Form
2. Toggle Guest Mode ON
3. Enter guest details:
   - **Name:** "John Smith"
   - **Phone:** "123-456-7890"
   - **Address:** "123 Main St"
4. Add products and create invoice
5. **Expected Result:** Invoice created successfully

### **Test 2: View Invoice Details**
1. Navigate to invoice list
2. Click on the guest invoice created in Test 1
3. Check "Customer Details" section
4. **Expected Result:** 
   - Shows "John Smith" (not "Guest Customer")
   - Shows "123-456-7890" 
   - Shows "123 Main St"

### **Test 3: Invoice List Display**
1. Go to invoice list/history
2. Check how guest invoice appears
3. **Expected Result:** Shows "John Smith (Guest)" in customer column

## ðŸŽ¯ **Before vs After**

### **BEFORE (Broken):**
```
Customer Details
Guest Customer
(No phone number shown)
```

### **AFTER (Fixed):**
```
Customer Details
John Smith
ðŸ“ž 123-456-7890
```

## âœ… **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] Guest customer invoices show actual guest name in details view
- [ ] Guest customer phone number displays correctly
- [ ] Guest customer address shows if provided
- [ ] Regular customer invoices still work normally
- [ ] Invoice lists show "GuestName (Guest)" format
- [ ] Dashboard analytics group guest customers properly

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Testing**

The fix is now active in the development server. You can test by:

1. **Creating a new guest invoice** with specific guest details
2. **Viewing the invoice details** to confirm the actual guest name appears
3. **Checking invoice lists** to see proper guest customer display

The issue should now be resolved - guest customer invoices will display the actual guest name and contact information instead of the placeholder "Guest Customer" text!

**Technical Note:** This fix maintains backward compatibility and doesn't require any database migrations. It simply changes how the data is retrieved and displayed for guest customers.
