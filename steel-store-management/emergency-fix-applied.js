ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY STOCK_MOVEMENTS FIX APPLIED

ðŸ“‹ Problem:
- Invoice creation failing with: "table stock_movements has no column named previous_stock"
- Root cause: existing database file missing required columns

ðŸ”§ Solution Applied:
âœ… Added emergency column fix directly in database initialization
âœ… Force-adds missing columns during every app startup:
   - previous_stock TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ""
   - new_stock TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ""  
   - unit_price REAL DEFAULT 0
   - total_value REAL DEFAULT 0

ðŸŽ¯ Implementation:
- Direct ALTER TABLE statements in initialize() method
- Runs after addMissingColumns() as backup
- Uses try/catch to handle "already exists" errors gracefully
- Console logs show success/failure status

ðŸ“Š Expected Result:
After restarting your development server:
âœ… Invoice creation should work without stock_movements errors
âœ… All database operations will have required columns
âœ… No data loss - existing records preserved

ðŸš€ This fix is permanent and will handle both:
- New database files (via CREATE TABLE schema)  
- Existing database files (via ALTER TABLE statements)

No manual intervention required - just restart the server!
