## üîç WHAT OUR SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY DOING

### **Current Implementation Analysis:**

#### **Option 1: Add to Customer Ledger** ‚úÖ **CORRECT**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Credit entry in customer ledger  
await this.dbConnection.execute(`
  INSERT INTO customer_ledger_entries (
    customer_id, entry_type, transaction_type, amount, description,
    balance_before, balance_after, date, time
  ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
`, [
  customer_id, 'credit', 'return', amount,
  `Return Credit - ${return_number}`,
  currentBalance, balanceAfterCredit, date, time
]);

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Update customer balance
await this.dbConnection.execute(
  'UPDATE customers SET balance = ? WHERE id = ?',
  [balanceAfterCredit, customer_id]
);
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY**

  amount: amount,
  customer_id: customer_id,
  payment_method: 'cash'
});

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: NO customer ledger entry (cash given physically)
console.log('Cash refund processed: NO customer ledger entry');
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY**

---

#### **Settlement Eligibility Logic** ‚úÖ **CORRECT**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Fully paid invoices get full refund
if (paymentStatus.is_fully_paid) {
  return {
    eligible_for_credit: true,
    credit_amount: returnAmount, // Full return amount
    allow_cash_refund: true     // Both options available
  };
}
```
