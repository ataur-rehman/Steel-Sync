# CustomerLedgerViewer Sorting & Balance Calculation Fix

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Transaction Sorting**
**Problem**: Transactions were not properly sorted by date and time in the component
**Solution**: Added comprehensive sorting logic in the `filteredTransactions` memoized function

### 2. **Incorrect Balance Calculation on Filtered Data**
**Problem**: Running balance was calculated on full dataset but displayed on filtered subset, causing incorrect balances
**Solution**: Recalculate running balance specifically for filtered transactions

## üöÄ Implementation Details

### Sorting Logic
```typescript
// Sort by date and time (newest first for display)
filtered = filtered.sort((a, b) => {
    // First sort by date (newest first)
    const dateComparison = new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime();
    if (dateComparison !== 0) {
        return dateComparison;
    }
    
    // If dates are equal, sort by time (newest first)
    const timeA = a.time || '00:00:00';
    const timeB = b.time || '00:00:00';
    return timeB.localeCompare(timeA);
});
```

### Balance Recalculation for Filtered Data
```typescript
// Sort chronologically for balance calculation
const chronological = [...filtered].sort((a, b) => {
    const dateComparison = new Date(a.date).getTime() - new Date(b.date).getTime();
    if (dateComparison !== 0) {
        return dateComparison;
    }
    const timeA = a.time || '00:00:00';
    const timeB = b.time || '00:00:00';
    return timeA.localeCompare(timeB);
});

// Calculate correct running balance for filtered set
let runningBalance = 0;
const withCorrectBalance = chronological.map(tx => {
    const debitAmount = tx.debit_amount || tx.invoice_amount || 0;
    const creditAmount = tx.credit_amount || tx.payment_amount || 0;
    runningBalance += debitAmount - creditAmount;
    
    return {
        ...tx,
        _runningBalance: runningBalance
    };
});

// Return in display order (newest first) with correct running balances
return withCorrectBalance.reverse();
```

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. **Manual Testing in Browser**
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to a customer ledger: `http://localhost:5175/customers/{id}`
3. Open browser console
4. Run the sorting checker:
   ```javascript
   // Load the checker script
   fetch('/check-ledger-sorting.js')
     .then(response => response.text())
     .then(script => eval(script));
   
   // Run the check
   checkLedgerSorting();
   ```

### 2. **Automated Testing Script**
Use the included `check-ledger-sorting.js` script which:
- ‚úÖ Verifies sorting is consistent (newest to oldest)
- ‚úÖ Checks balance calculations are mathematically correct
- ‚úÖ Reports any discrepancies
- üìä Provides summary statistics

### 3. **Test Scenarios to Verify**

#### A. **Date/Time Sorting**
- [ ] Transactions are displayed newest first
- [ ] Same-date transactions are sorted by time (newest first)
- [ ] Date format parsing works correctly
- [ ] Time component is considered (not just date)

#### B. **Balance Calculation**
- [ ] Starting balance is correct
- [ ] Each transaction updates balance correctly:
  - Debits (invoices) increase balance (customer owes more)
  - Credits (payments) decrease balance (customer owes less)
- [ ] Running balance progression is mathematically sound
- [ ] Final balance matches expected value

#### C. **Filtering Impact**
- [ ] Search filtering maintains correct chronological balance calculation
- [ ] Date range filtering recalculates balances properly
- [ ] Transaction type filtering preserves balance accuracy
- [ ] Combined filters work correctly together

#### D. **Edge Cases**
- [ ] Same timestamp transactions are handled consistently
- [ ] Missing time components default to '00:00:00'
- [ ] Zero-amount transactions don't break calculations
- [ ] Large datasets (1000+ transactions) sort correctly

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Sorting Order
```
Newest Transaction (2024-03-15 14:30:00)
    ‚Üì
Recent Transaction (2024-03-15 10:15:00)
    ‚Üì
Older Transaction (2024-03-14 16:45:00)
    ‚Üì
Oldest Transaction (2024-03-01 09:00:00)
```

### Balance Calculation
```
Starting Balance: 0
+ Invoice #1001 (Debit): +1000 = Balance: 1000
- Payment #P001 (Credit): -500 = Balance: 500
+ Invoice #1002 (Debit): +750 = Balance: 1250
- Payment #P002 (Credit): -1250 = Balance: 0
```

## üö® Critical Points

1. **Two-Phase Sorting**: 
   - First: Chronological order for balance calculation
   - Second: Reverse chronological for display

2. **Balance Calculation**: 
   - Always calculated on chronologically sorted data
   - Debits increase balance (what customer owes)
   - Credits decrease balance (payments reduce debt)

3. **Filter Handling**: 
   - Filtering happens before balance recalculation
   - Ensures filtered views show correct running balances
   - Maintains referential integrity

## üîç Debugging

If issues persist, check:

1. **Database Query**: Verify `getCustomerLedger()` returns data with proper date/time fields
2. **Time Format**: Ensure time strings are in HH:MM:SS format
3. **Amount Fields**: Check debit_amount, credit_amount, invoice_amount, payment_amount mapping
4. **Date Format**: Verify dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format for proper sorting

## üìà Performance Impact

- **Sorting**: O(n log n) complexity - acceptable for typical ledger sizes
- **Balance Recalculation**: O(n) complexity - linear time for filtered set
- **Memory**: Minimal additional overhead (creates sorted copy)
- **User Experience**: Imperceptible delay for datasets under 10,000 transactions

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist
