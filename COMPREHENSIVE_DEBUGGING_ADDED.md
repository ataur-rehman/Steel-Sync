# 🐛 COMPREHENSIVE DEBUGGING ADDED - Scenario 5 Issue Tracking

## Debugging Added to Track Scenario 5 Failures

I've added comprehensive debugging throughout the invoice creation process to help identify exactly what's happening when Scenario 5 fails.

---

## 🔍 Debug Points Added

### 1. **Initial Values Debug** (`🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 1]`)
- Shows: customerId, grandTotal, originalPaymentAmount, effectivePaymentAmount, paymentSourceType

### 2. **Customer Query Debug** (`🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 2]`)  
- Shows: Customer database query result
- Identifies if customer exists and what the query returns

### 3. **Balance Calculation Debug** (`🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 3]`)
- Shows: currentBalance, availableCredit, calculation logic
- Traces: `currentBalance < 0 ? Math.abs(currentBalance) : 0`

### 4. **Credit Calculation Debug** (`🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 4]`)
- Shows: availableCredit, grandTotal, effectivePaymentAmount  
- Shows: `Math.min(availableCredit, grandTotal - effectivePaymentAmount)` calculation
- Shows: Why credit is or isn't used

### 5. **Credit Application Debug** (`🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 5]`)
- Shows: Before/after effectivePaymentAmount values
- Shows: creditToUse amount and calculation
- Shows: autoUsedCredit flag status

### 6. **Status Logic Debug** (`🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 6]`)
- Shows: Whether invoice will be marked as FULLY PAID or PARTIALLY PAID
- Shows: `effectivePaymentAmount >= grandTotal` comparison

### 7. **Final Calculations Debug** (`🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 7]`)
- Shows: effectiveRemainingBalance calculation
- Shows: `grandTotal - effectivePaymentAmount = effectiveRemainingBalance`
- Shows: Status determination logic

### 8. **Invoice Update Debug** (`🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 8-10]`)
- Shows: SQL update parameters being sent
- Shows: Status logic evaluation
- Shows: Database update result
- **Verification**: Reads back actual database values after update

### 9. **Customer Ledger Debug** (`🐛 [LEDGER DEBUG 1]`)
- Shows: Customer ledger calculation logic
- Shows: Credit usage in ledger vs invoice logic
- Shows: Balance calculations step by step

### 10. **Final Verification Debug** (`🐛 [FINAL VERIFICATION]`)
- **Critical**: Checks actual database state after commit
- **Compares**: Expected vs actual values
- **Alerts**: Shows critical errors if values don't match

---

## 🚨 Critical Error Detection

The debugging will now automatically detect and alert for:

### ❌ Payment Amount Mismatch
```
🚨 [CRITICAL ERROR] Payment amount mismatch! Expected: 5000, Actual: 6000
```

### ❌ Status Mismatch  
```
🚨 [CRITICAL ERROR] Status mismatch! Expected: partially_paid, Actual: paid
```

### ❌ Calculation Inconsistencies
The debug logs will show if:
- Credit calculation differs between invoice logic and ledger logic
- effectivePaymentAmount gets modified incorrectly
- Database update doesn't match expected values

## 🎯 How to Use These Debug Logs

### When Scenario 5 Fails Again:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Create the problematic invoice** (Customer with 5000 credit, 6000 invoice)
3. **Look for these debug messages** in order:

```
🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 1] Initial values: {...}
🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 2] Customer query result: {...}  
🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 3] Balance calculation: {...}
🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 4] Credit calculation: {...}
🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 5] Credit usage applied: {...}
🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 6] Status: PARTIALLY PAID - {...}
🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 7] Final calculations: {...}
🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 8] Updating invoice with: {...}
🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 9] Update result: {...}
🐛 [INVOICE DEBUG 10] Verification after update: {...}
🐛 [LEDGER DEBUG 1] Customer ledger calculations: {...}
🐛 [FINAL VERIFICATION] Database state after commit: {...}
```

4. **Look for 🚨 [CRITICAL ERROR] messages**
5. **Share the complete debug output** - this will pinpoint exactly where the calculation goes wrong

### Expected Values for Your Scenario:
- **availableCredit**: 5000
- **creditToUse**: 5000  
- **effectivePaymentAmount**: 5000
- **effectiveRemainingBalance**: 1000
- **Status**: "partially_paid"
- **Final verification should match expected values**

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Test Scenario 5 again** with these debug logs
2. **Copy all debug output** from browser console
3. **Share the output** - we'll be able to see exactly where the bug occurs
4. **Look for patterns** - does it fail consistently or intermittently?

**This comprehensive debugging will help us catch the exact moment when the calculation goes wrong and fix it permanently!** 🎯
