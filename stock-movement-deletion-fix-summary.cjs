/**
 * üéØ Summary: Better Stock Movement Deletion Implementation
 * 
 * This summarizes the changes made to fix the stock movement deletion issue.
 */

console.log('üéØ INVOICE DELETION STOCK MOVEMENT FIX - SUMMARY\n');

console.log('‚ùå PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:');
console.log('Your current code was:');
console.log('1. Marking original stock movements as "CANCELLED"');
console.log('2. Creating NEW restoration movements (IN movements)');
console.log('3. This resulted in confusing dual entries in stock history');
console.log('');

console.log('‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:');
console.log('Changed the logic to:');
console.log('1. DELETE original stock movements completely');
console.log('2. Recalculate product stock from remaining movements');
console.log('3. Clean, simple approach - as if invoice never existed');
console.log('');

console.log('üîß CODE CHANGES MADE:');
console.log('File: src/services/database.ts');
console.log('Functions Updated:');
console.log('  - deleteInvoice() - lines ~11970-12000');
console.log('  - deleteInvoiceEnhanced() - lines ~12130-12200');
console.log('');
console.log('Key Changes:');
console.log('  1. Replaced stock restoration loops with simple DELETE query');
console.log('  2. Added recalculateProductStockFromMovements() calls');
console.log('  3. Removed creation of restoration stock movements');
console.log('  4. Removed cancellation marking logic');
console.log('');

console.log('üìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW:');
console.log('Before deletion:');
console.log('  Invoice: Sold 25kg Rice');
console.log('  Stock Movement: OUT -25kg (reference: invoice 123)');
console.log('  Product Stock: 75kg');
console.log('');
console.log('After deletion:');
console.log('  Stock Movement: (DELETED - no trace)');
console.log('  Product Stock: 100kg (recalculated from remaining movements)');
console.log('  Stock History: Clean - no cancelled or restoration entries');
console.log('');

console.log('üöÄ BENEFITS:');
console.log('‚úÖ Cleaner stock history');
console.log('‚úÖ No confusing cancelled/restoration entries');
console.log('‚úÖ True reversal (as if invoice never happened)');
console.log('‚úÖ Simpler logic and better performance');
console.log('‚úÖ Uses existing recalculation method for accuracy');
console.log('');

console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:');
console.log('üîç The recalculateProductStockFromMovements() method ensures accuracy');
console.log('üîç Stock levels will be correct even if movements are out of order');
console.log('üîç Fallback logic included in case recalculation fails');
console.log('üîç Transaction safety maintained for data integrity');
console.log('');

console.log('üß™ TO TEST:');
console.log('1. Start your Tauri app: npm run tauri dev');
console.log('2. Create an invoice with stock items');
console.log('3. Delete the invoice');
console.log('4. Check stock history - should be clean');
console.log('5. Check product stock - should be correctly restored');
console.log('');

console.log('‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED: Stock movements are now properly deleted instead of creating restoration entries!');
