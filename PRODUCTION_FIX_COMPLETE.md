# 🔧 PRODUCTION FIX APPLIED - INVOICE BALANCE CALCULATIONS

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED

**Your Issue:** Invoice shows 10,000 outstanding when it should show 0
- Invoice Total: 23,000
- Returns: 10,000 
- Payment: 13,000
- Expected Balance: 0
- Actual Balance: 10,000 ❌

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**Missing Database Triggers** - The database had no automatic triggers to update invoice balances when:
- Returns are processed
- Payments are made
- Items are edited

## ⚡ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Created Essential Tables
```sql
- invoices (with proper balance tracking)
- invoice_items (linked to invoices)
- return_items (linked to invoice_items)
```

### 2. Created Balance Calculation Triggers
```sql
- trg_update_balance_on_return_insert
- trg_update_balance_on_return_delete  
- trg_update_balance_on_payment
```

### 3. Fixed Calculation Formula
```sql
remaining_balance = grand_total - total_returns - payment_amount
```
